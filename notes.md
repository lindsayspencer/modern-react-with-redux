# Notes


## Getting Started

React.js is a JavaScript library, with the purpose of showing HTML content to users and handling user interaction. It can be used to have the users interact and affect the HTML content.

React can work by itself without added libraries like Redux - but third-party packages or libraries exist to make the build process faster and easier instead of making things from scratch.

React components are made using JS functions (pre ES2015) or classes (post ES2015). Components are the most basic building blocks of React. A single component has a single purpose to contribute to the purpose of React - to render HTML and handle user interaction.

JSX is not necessary to use React, but is a useful feature. It looks like HTML but can be written as JS. It gets compiled by babel into vanilla JS.

Event handlers are used to detect user interaction and respond to it by implementing changes in the UI. *Responding to user interaction is a main purpose of React.*

React + ReactDOM libraries...
React library = contains code that defines what a component is and how the components work together to form a single application.
ReactDOM library = gets the components to render as HTML.
Both libraries are needed.

### Steps

Install/Update Node Js -> Install create-react-app -> Generate a project -> Build project!
